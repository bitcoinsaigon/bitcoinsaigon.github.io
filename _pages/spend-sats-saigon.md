The Bitcoin Community in Saigon has these days thanks to the dedicated work of some people within the community been able to expand the reach of Bitcoin Merchants in Saigon.

Not only can you wine & dine at your pleasure at a variety of venues - our long-standing community supporter [Dave Watson](https://twitter.com/watson_ita) of [future.travel](http://www.future.travel) (the first merchant in Vietnam to implement Bitcoin payments in 2015) will also get your flights, hotel and visa arranged - all for a handful of Sats.

#### Food & Beverage Venues

[Italiani’s](http://www.italianis.vn)

- Address (District 1): 17 Han Thuyen, Ben Nghe, D1, HCMC
- Style: Italian restaurant ([Pizza & Pasta](https://italianis.vn/#menu))

Led by the [young Vietnamese entrepreneurs Kevin and Ariel](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/interview-with-ariel-nguyen-of-italianis) Italiani’s has been a meeting point for the local Bitcoin community since 2016.
As such, their original location also wrote a little Vietnamese Bitcoin history, [hosting the very first Bitcoin ATM](http://btm.bitcoinvn.io)  [in Vietnam back in 2016](https://ice3x.co.za/first-bitcoin-atm-in-vietnam/).

Their venue in Han Thuyen is located romantically right next to 30/04 park between the Independence palace and Notre Dame church.

So if outside the usual Bitcoin meetups you are looking for the right venue for a date night - food & ambience certainly will not disappoint!

#### Online Merchants

[Future.travel](https://future.travel/)

Sector: Online Travel Agency (Flights, Cruises, Hotels, Visas and more!)

If there is one person in Saigon and possibly all over Vietnam who deserves the title as *the* doyen of Bitcoin merchant adoption in Vietnam, then it is Future Travel General Director David Watson.

An entrepreneur from head to toe and with business operating experience across 4 different continents in his long career, [he has been back in 2015 the first merchant to accept Bitcoin for his service offerings](http://www.coinnewsasia.com/vietnam-adds-its-first-bitcoin-merchant/) at his travel agency.

He and his firm have been a steady supporter over the years of the local community - be it the efforts around [Bitfilm Festival 2015](https://www.coinnewsasia.com/bitcoin-saigon-to-host-the-first-bitfilm-festival/); [BlockFin Asia](http://www.blockfin.asia/) or sponsoring the [Bitcoin Lightning Node of the local community](https://1ml.com/node/023e4a4c0e0e114d88ab50ec14582fefd60ad8baae63eb0934db146d995c5567d7).

Dave himself is also a regular at the local Bitcoin meetups and probably the person who has set up the most people with wallets and their first Sats all across the country.
