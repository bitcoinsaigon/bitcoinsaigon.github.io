After maintaining for several years a static page of Bitcoin merchants in town, weâ€™ve come to the conclusion that the high turnover of businesses accepting Bitcoin - many of whom later dropped it or simply went out of business - made it no longer feasible to maintain such a page reliably.

More often than not, the list ended up misleading Bitcoiners visiting Saigon, as the place they had hoped to support either no longer existed or had quietly removed Bitcoin from its payment options.

Instead, weâ€™ve decided to re-focus our efforts on supporting the excellent BTCMap project, which aims to maintain a dynamically updated map of Bitcoin merchants around the world, including Vietnam. The project is open-source, community-driven and fully reliant on donations - so if you find their service useful (or simply want to support their mission), consider sending a few sats their way.

That said, weâ€™re not forgetting our local heroes. Below, youâ€™ll still find a shortlist of long-standing merchants in Saigon who have accepted Bitcoin reliably for over two years and have been personally vetted by active members of the Bitcoin Saigon community. These are businesses we know and trust - the kind you can confidently recommend to fellow Bitcoiners.

If you operate a Bitcoin-friendly business in Saigon and believe you meet the criteria to be added to this vetted list, get in touch with us!

A Special Acknowledgment

A very special thanks and deep gratitude go to David Watson of Future.Travel, who has long served as the grand doyen and true pioneer of Bitcoin merchant adoption in Vietnam.

For many years, David has led by example - not only as the first merchant in Vietnam to accept Bitcoin (since 2015), but also as a consistent advocate for broader adoption across the country. His tireless efforts and continued support for the community have left a lasting mark.

The service and contributions of David Watson will not be forgotten - they remain a cornerstone of Bitcoin Saigonâ€™s early merchant network and community ethos.
