Bitcoin & Meat - latest since the trend towards Bitcoin Carnivory which was set in Motion by [Michael Goldstein of the Nakamoto Institute several years ago](https://twitter.com/bitstein/status/874049065142677504), it has become a match made in heaven for a strong subsection of the Bitcoin Community. 

Hard money in combination with hard muscles - built by consumption of large swaths of meat.

All of that you can have at [Rob Rankin’s Big Pig BBQ](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/interview-rob-rankin-big-pig-bbq-utit-vn/?lang=en) with currently two locations in town; one of them right next to Tân Sơn Nhất Airport within five minutes walking distance to the terminal.

Besides being able to exchange Sats for Steak - they’re also host of some of the [Bitcoin ATMs in town](http://btm.bitcoinvn.io).

If there is one person in Saigon and possibly all over Vietnam who deserves the title as *the* doyen of Bitcoin merchant adoption in Vietnam, then it is [Future.Travel](https://future.travel/)’s General Director David Watson.

An entrepreneur from head to toe and with business operating experience across 4 different continents in his long career,  [back in 2015 they were the first merchant to accept Bitcoin for service offerings](http://www.coinnewsasia.com/vietnam-adds-its-first-bitcoin-merchant/) at the travel agency.

He and his firm have been a steady supporter over the years of the local community - be it the efforts around [Bitfilm Festival 2015](https://www.coinnewsasia.com/bitcoin-saigon-to-host-the-first-bitfilm-festival/); [BlockFin Asia](http://www.blockfin.asia/) or sponsoring the [Bitcoin Lightning Node of the local community](https://1ml.com/node/023e4a4c0e0e114d88ab50ec14582fefd60ad8baae63eb0934db146d995c5567d7).

Dave himself is also a regular at the local Bitcoin meetups and probably the person who has set up the most people with wallets and their first Sats all across the country.
