With the first iteration of the [Global Online Meetup](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/global-bitcoin-meetup-agenda/) organized by the [Greek Community](https://www.meetup.com/Greek-Cryptocurrency-community/) now a few days behind us, we have used the time to ready the full recording for those of you who missed out to follow the premier life.

Some of the highlights of the talks were also summarized in the [accompanying Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon/status/1307294624176697344) on the [Bitcoin Saigon Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitcoinsaigon?lang=en) feed. 

We would like to express our gratitude to [Monis](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/interview-monis-organizer-global-bitcoin-meetup/) and all the other helping hands behind the scene who made this idea become a reality!


[Monis:](https://twitter.com/cryptotechgr)“Bitcoin connects people. We have all just proved, how far this can go. Thank you for trusting us and all the efforts it took to make this happen.  This video, will be our legacy for the years to come and hopefully, a beginning for more similar attempts.”
