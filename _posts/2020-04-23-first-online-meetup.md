While the current situation around the Coronavirus has made our regular weekly meetups for our local Bitcoin community impossible for the time, we are looking forward to offering an online alternative to keep all of us connected & discuss the newest trends, topics and happenings in and around the Bitcoin space (and there are many!).

"Playtime is over” for Bitcoin and in the upcoming decade it will have to prove that it can live up to its promise to serve as a liferaft in an increasingly upside-down world and if “Plan B” can succeed to guide us to a more prosperous future with a reemergence of apolitical, sound money as base of our economy and productive endeavours.

Join us for the first Bitcoin Saigon Online Meetup on the 30th of April 2020!

Since it is a “first one” we kept it very casual for this time around - but you can find a rough timeline here:

- 8.00 PM - 8.15PM --- Warm-up & Introductions
- 8.15 PM - 8.45 PM --- Lightning Network
- 8.45 PM - 9.15 PM --- Bitcoin & Global Markets
- 9.15 PM - open end --- Beginner Q & A
