The past couple of weeks, our little Christmas helpers have kept busy preparing the 2nd Satoshi Christmas Flea Market Saigon \- combined with our summer edition now making it the 4th event in a row, steadily turning into a regular get-together for the Bitcoin community and their friends in Saigon.

This time we anticipate an expanded vendor line-up, additional entertainment stations for the kids (our common future\!), and of course your very own **Satoshi Santa** in full dress \- always ready for a chat about his impressive family history. This year, we’ll have Photos with Santa- where kids can ask what they wish for, and adults can brag about taking a photo with Satoshi Santa.

_For the juniors & the seniors \- Satoshi Santa is always ready for a quick chat\!_

## A sincere thank-you to all supporters so far \- without you, this event simply wouldn’t be possible.

It lives and dies with the support of the community and its friends. Our gratitude goes out to everyone who, over the past weeks, contributed in word, deed, or Sats to bring all moving parts together for this final event in the Bitcoin event calendar in (South) East Asia.

### To note:

This event is for people who share the Bitcoin ethos: honest money, long-term thinking, real community, and genuine value creation. If you’re here to push altcoins, quick-profit schemes, or extractive “crypto” hustle culture, this is not your space. Show up in good faith \- or don’t show up at all.

## Our current expected vendor line-up includes among others:

We expect 1–2 more vendors to join on short notice \- keep an eye on our posts in the event group on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/786196570921278/), [Twitter/X](https://x.com/BitcoinSaigon/status/1984948200252555497), and (of course) [Nostr](https://primal.net/BitcoinSaigon).

If you’re a potential vendor or know someone who fits the spirit of the event, please reach out. Space is getting tight and we’re close to “full house,” but if you’re genuinely committed to the cause, we’ll find a way to make room.

Booth fees are intentionally kept very low to stay accessible for people just getting started in business, hobbyists, and passion projects. We aim to *encourage* grassroots creators \- not to gatekeep participation through high fees that only established commercial enterprises can afford.

## Of course, we want to keep the event as community-based as possible and true to the “bottom-up” spirit of Bitcoin \- peer-to-peer.

We have always aimed \- and will continue to aim \- to cover the majority of the budget through community donations. The broad support from local, regional, and global Bitcoiners is the key indicator if we’re on the right track and aligned with the broader orange mission.

This event is not organized “to make money,” but to strengthen the human layer of the Bitcoin Network \- fostering more peer-to-peer connections between community members, vendors, service providers, growers, craftspeople, and everyone else who contributes to real, direct commerce within the community.

We thank everyone for their support so far and appreciate any further Sats coming our way to keep the event series ongoing and sustainable.

Please help us reach our goal to [fully cover the event budget of **1,000,000 Sats**](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/donate-satoshis.html).
