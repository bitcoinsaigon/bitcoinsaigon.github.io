Five Years Bitcoin Saigon - it was two days packed with deep discussion around the past, present, and future of Bitcoin on various topics such as privacy, scaling, data transparency, and resilience against fundamental attack vectors.

But it was also two days that we enjoyed sharing thoughts, ideas, and simply having a good time with all our friends from across the wider region who came down to see us and celebrate this special event with us.

Thank you again to all our attendees - and we welcome you back to Vietnam any time!
