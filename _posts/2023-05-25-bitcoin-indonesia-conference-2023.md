**_On 26th & 27th of October the South-East Asian Bitcoin communities are coming together for the finale event of 2023 - this time for the [Indonesia Bitcoin conference](https://indonesiabitcoinconference.com/) in the beautiful island of Bali!_**

2023 has been the year that the Bitcoin communities across South East Asia became wide alive.

While there were always Bitcoiners around, doing their thing in their respective locations - there has been so far (with the notable exception of the early pioneering work of the [Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong](https://www.bitcoin.org.hk/)) very little on offer in regional and international events from Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners.

Most events in our part of the world ended up being massive shitcoin festivals on stage and in the audience - nothing a self-respecting human would like to voluntarily expose themselves to.

**2023 saw a big change in this regard.**

With travel restrictions finally lifted across the region, the hunger for cross-border collaboration and meeting the other Bitcoiners in the region has taken off drastically.

Starting with our very own [LightningCon in Da Nang](lightningcon.org) earlier this year, we saw the first [Bitcoin Island Retreat in Boracay](https://twitter.com/BtcRetreat) and are looking forward to [Thailands first Bitcoin Conference in July of this year](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/bitcoin-thailand-conference-2023/).

Friendships have been forged and renewed, plenty of advanced conversations have been held and business collaborations have been put on the way.

The world is in dire need of alternatives - and itâ€™s on us to build them.

If you want to be part of it and have that orange blood in you, check out the [Indonesia Bitcoin Conference ticketing ](https://megatix.co.id/white-label/idbc2023#/booking)- early Bird tickets are available now.
