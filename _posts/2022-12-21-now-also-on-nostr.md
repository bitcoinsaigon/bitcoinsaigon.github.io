Your favorites bunch of whacky Bitcoiners in Saigon - now also available on [Nostr](https://nostr.com).

You know what to do with it.

While [Nostr is still pretty much an early-stage alpha version](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) - the fact that certain BigTech companies felt the need to call Nostr out by name despite just being a couple of hundred users certainly allows for raised eyebrows.

Naturally, the current userbase of Nostr has quite an overweight in fans of the orange coin - you can check out [nostr.directory](https://www.nostr.directory/) to discover some of your favourite follows from the bluebird app.

Furthermore we have been following and supporting the efforts of [fellow Bitcoiner & Lightning tinkerer Fiatjaf](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/interview-with-lntxbot-creator-fiatjaf/) for several years by now, therefore being early adopters of Nostr - after being early adopters of [LNTXBot](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/lntxbot-lightning-wallet-telegram/) -  is just keeping up with a good tradition.

So if you don’t like [Telegram](https://t.me/BitcoinSaigon_public), don’t like [Twitter](www.twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon) - you can find updates from the community now also via Nostr.

Good luck to [Fiatjaf](https://astral.ninja/3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d) & the gang to make Nostr protocol a thing!
