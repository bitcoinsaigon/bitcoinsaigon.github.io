_TL, DR: Fundraising to cover the costs of the upcoming Summer Satoshi Flea Market Saigon is live - either directly via our [donation page](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/donate-satoshis) or via the official Geyser campaign_

We're happy to announce the bi-annual Satoshi Flea Market Summer date - **mark your calendars for July 20th.**

Following the sad closure of our long-time home Indika Saigon - a place that hosted countless community moments since 2018 - this edition will take place at a **new location in District 2**.

Details will be shared in the coming weeks across the usual channels.

The initiative was first launched in the summer of 2024 - inspired by successful Satoshi Flea Markets around the world, from the **[Bitcoin Farmers Market in El Salvador](https://linktr.ee/bitcoinfarmersmarket)** to the **[Lightning Marché in Tokyo](https://bitcoin-zukan.com/en/practical/lightning-marche/)**.

Since then, it has grown into an emerging local tradition and even attracted “high-profile visitors” from the global Bitcoin community - including Ms. Bitcoin from El Salvador, who attended the most recent Christmas edition of the bi-annual event.

In order to make an impact:

Funding is needed to make this a communal grassroots event. We intentionally keep vendor fees low to make it accessible for friends and family of the community to showcase their homemade cookies, crafts, and passion projects, rather than turning it into a commercial market dominated by professional vendors.

Vendor fees alone typically do not cover the event costs and** the shortfall must be funded from the community treasury reserves.**

Relying on our treasury is limiting, that is why we also count on donations from Bitcoiners around the world to help us continue spreading the orange signal and foster community connections here in Vietnam.

The event itself isn’t limited to Bitcoiners - but most vendors are friends and family of the local community, operating with a mindset that’s naturally aligned with Bitcoin values.

You could call them highly promising pre-coiners - individuals already living the ethos, just waiting for the final piece to click into place.

Quality and pride in their product, not just quick money grab - the very work ethos which we believe makes them also ready to endorse Bitcoin as honest money for honest people.

Especially in a place like Vietnam - where the term “crypto” has become toxic, and most decent people instinctively and rightfully recoil when they hear it - it’s more important than ever to show that Bitcoin represents something fundamentally different.

Bitcoiners are - and proudly so - a different breed. \

We reject the shallow, extractive mentality of the shitcoin Pump-n-Dump crowd - those who lie, cheat, and leave everything worse than they found it in the name of fast profit.

Bitcoin is about building.

Building trust. Building real value.

And building a future that doesn’t rot from the inside out.

As usual, **shitcoiners are not welcome** - but anyone aligned with the Bitcoin ethos and a love for organic food, handmade goods, and natural living will feel right at home.

As always, it’s a **family-friendly gathering** - kids running around, home-baked cookies, good conversations and true value-for-value exchange taking place - building for a brighter tomorrow.
