The Satoshi Summer Flea Market is back in Saigon!

Join us for the **Summer 2025 edition** of the Saigon Satoshi Flea Market - a laid-back gathering of the local Bitcoin community, friends, and families who share a low-time-preference approach to food, craft, manufacturing, and meaningful living.

Expect good vibes, unique goods, and conversations that outlast your phone battery.

From handcrafted items to Bitcoin merch and locally made treats, there‚Äôs something for every Bitcoiner (and Bitcoiner-to-be) to enjoy!
