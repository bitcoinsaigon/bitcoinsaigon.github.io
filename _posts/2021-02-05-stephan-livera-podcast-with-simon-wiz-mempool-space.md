If you have attended any of the recent Bitcoin Saigon meetups then most likely you had the lucky chance to exchange your thoughts about the future of the Bitcoin Ecosystem with Simon of the trailblazing [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) Blockchain Explorer project.

[Simon](http://www.twitter.com/softsimon_) & [Wiz](http://www.twitter.com/wiz) (who also attended our local meetups in previous years) have been taken Mempool.space over the past year to a new level - filling to gap to provide an Open Source Tool for the Bitcoin Community to become more efficient in their Blockspace usage & transaction fee estimation without constantly being tracked as it is the case with various VC-funded closed source Block Explorers.

> “So if you don’t want to use like a totally closed source. A centralised website, that’s probably logging all of your queries and using all kinds of third-party trackers and analytics. It’s really cool to have an open source tool that you can even just self host locally and not have to trust anybody connect to your own node. If you’re looking for tools, even if it’s not fee estimation or block exploring, just to like be able to know that someone’s not logging your data and connect it to your own full node is really huge. And if you have a tool like that with a really slick UX and design I think you can have the best of both worlds where it’s fast and local and self-sovereign.” (Wiz)

Both of them joined [Stephan Livera](http://www.twitter.com/stephanlivera) on [Episode 245](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/245/) of his [highly recommendable Bitcoin Podcast](https://stephanlivera.com/episodes/) which over the past three years interviewed many of the movers and shakers in and around the Bitcoin Community globally.

Mempool.space is an Open Source Project funded by donations from the Bitcoin Community - and built as a tool for the Bitcoin community to transition into the future of scarce Blockspace and a multi-layered transaction infrastructure.
