For the second time, “Bitcoin Asia” - the largest Bitcoin-focused conference in the region, backed by the team behind _Bitcoin Magazine_ - is taking place this year. Once again, the venue is the globally renowned port and trading city of Hong Kong, which has, over its varied and volatile history, firmly established itself as a key gateway for commerce and a vital trade hub connecting East and West.

Bitcoin Asia 2025 is, by necessity, a different kind of conference than what many in the “Bitcoin pleb” community may be used to. If you're planning to attend, keep in mind that its sheer scale means it won’t offer the same level of intimacy as the smaller, grassroots Bitcoin gatherings you might be more familiar with.

That said, it stands out as the most business- and policy-oriented Bitcoin conference in Asia this year. If you're working professionally in the industry, this is one event you likely shouldn’t miss.

While “true orange-blooded Bitcoiners” might be a minority in the main crowd, the city will still be buzzing with Bitcoiners from across Asia and beyond - and you can count on a host of side events that cater more to your taste.

The Bitcoin community in Hong Kong - under the wise guidance of the [Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong](https://www.bitcoin.org.hk/) and its (former) president Leo Weese - played a leading and inspirational role in shaping the development of Bitcoin communities across Southeast Asia during Bitcoin’s first decade.

Not only did the Hong Kong Bitcoin crew show strong support during milestones such as the [5-Year Anniversary of the Bitcoin Saigon community](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/five-year-anniversary-recap-video/), they remain active to this day - notably as [key supporters of the annual Li Xi campaign](https://x.com/BitcoinSaigon/status/1871844239338029472), a region-wide initiative that was originally launched in Hong Kong.

The city hosted its first major Bitcoin conference back in 2014 with “Inside Bitcoins” and has since seen a steady stream of Bitcoin-centric events over the years - most notably the annual Spotconf, which ran every summer until the lockdown years brought the tradition to a crushing halt.

While the lockdown years forced major changes - including the departure of many Bitcoin OGs from Hong Kong - other digital nomad hubs such as Chiang Mai and Bali saw a growing influx of Bitcoiners fleeing failing Western societies. These new arrivals helped fuel the rise of stronger and more diverse Bitcoin communities in those locations.

Despite these shifts, Hong Kong remains a key anchor in Southeast Asia’s economic landscape - and continues to serve as the “gateway to the world” for 21st-century superpower China.
