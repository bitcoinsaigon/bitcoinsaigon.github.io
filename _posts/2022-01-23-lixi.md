## Bitcoin Lì Xì

In Vietnam it is customary to gift money for special occasions, especially Lunar New Year (Tét), weddings and births. The cash is typically enclosed in a red envelope (also called red pocket, Bao lì xì). The envelope is gifted, the recipient takes out the cash from the envelope. The Bitcoin Lì Xì achieves the same experience using LNURL-withdrawal QR codes that can be gifted electronically or physically.

Happy year of the Tiger!

## Redeeming Your Bitcoin Lì Xì

To redeem your Lì Xì, you need a Lightning wallet that supports LNURL-withdrawal, such as [Breez](https://breez.technology/), [BLW](https://lightning-wallet.com/), [Bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io/), [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) or [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/). You can find [a complete list here](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl/#wallets).

Simply scan the QR code of your Bitcoin Lì Xì. You are shown the amount you are able to withdraw. Confirm, and the funds should appear in your wallet.
