_TL, DR: In need of a ticket for Bitcoin Seoul? [Here you go](https://www.bitcoinseoul.kr/en/)._

After a long absence of in-person gatherings during the lockdown years, the Bitcoin communities across Asia were treated last year with gatherings in Da Nang, Boracay, Bangkok, and finally Bali.

Following an event rally that lasted from March until September, and countless connections forged between the builders and doers in the communities across the region, a necessary hiatus took place heading into the Lunar New Year.

In 2024, we're seeing several alternative locations shaping up for the Asian Bitcoin Conference gathering

[Seoul](https://www.bitcoinseoul.kr/en/) and [Hong Kong](https://b.tc/conference/asia) in May, followed by Bangkok and Tokyo in early fall.

Bitcoin Seoul 2024 will take place from May 29th to 31st, 2024, at The Shilla & SFACTORY, as part of the larger SEOUL FORUM event.

_Lead Organizer [Calvin Kim](https://twitter.com/kcalvinalvinn): “Bitcoin Seoul Conference hopes to accelerate Bitcoin adoption in Korea by providing locals with the opportunity to meet and interact with developers, thought leaders and entrepreneurs. Koreans have had a lot of interest in Bitcoin but there weren’t enough resources to meet the demand. With this conference, we hope to inspire and connect people that are interested in Bitcoin.”_

Besides many local and regional leading Asian Bitcoin builders, some well-known names in Bitcoin & Lightning development will make their appearance in Seoul, including [Roasbeef of Lightning Labs](https://github.com/Roasbeef), Bitcoin Core maintainer [Gloria Zhao](https://github.com/glozow), and [Jimmy Song](https://github.com/jimmysong).

_"Imagine South Korea, home to Samsung, Hyundai, K-Pop, and K-Dramas understands Bitcoin. _

_Korea could influence Asia and beyond with its tech and cultural clout. Bitcoin Seoul will mark the start of the journey."_

The local Bitcoin Community in Vietnam will be presented on stage by [Neutronpay](neutronpay.com) Founder [Albert Buu](www.twitter.com/subnetmask).
