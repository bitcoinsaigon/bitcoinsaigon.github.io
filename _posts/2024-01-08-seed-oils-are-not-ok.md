In 2024 and onward, we will reward those establishments who have already switched & committed to seed-oil free cooking & meal preparation.

We will bring you more business and more endorsements.

We will also continue to encourage the venues & locations in our vicinity to make the move towards cooking with traditional & animal fats.

A strong and healthy community requires strong and healthy individual members.

Provide customers with quality food - and you will gain quality customers.
