The third edition of the Satoshi Flea Market Saigon came and went - and despite a good bit of flooding summer rain in the early afternoon, over 200 visitors made their way through the gates of our new host venue: Funk Factory Saigon.

The main objectives we pursue with our semi-regular public Flea Markets is two -(maybe three-?) fold:

On one hand, the local Bitcoin OG community has become fairly reclusive in recent years - many having shifted focus toward family life or other long-term priorities. The twice-yearly Flea Market offers a casual gathering point to reconnect: to share old war stories, swap ideas, and catch up over Vietnamese coffee, home-baked cinnamon rolls, or a range of other lovingly crafted items from our vendors.

At the same time, we hope to introduce more ‚Äúpromising pre-coiners‚Äù to the Bitcoin ethos - many of whom already embody low-time preference and a commitment to quality in their craft, artisanal goods, or services, even if they haven‚Äôt taken the full orange pill just yet.

Rumour has it, a fair amount of Sats changed hands - alongside strengthening the connections of ‚ÄúLayer Zero‚Äù of the Bitcoin Network: the human layer that makes it all work behind the computer screens, servers, nodes, and application-layer services.

We‚Äôd once again like to extend our sincere thanks to the donors who made it all possible - without their support, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep the event running sustainably and on a regular schedule.

Dozens of individuals from around the world contributed Sats - some small, others surprisingly generous. Many of them remain anonymous (and can, thanks to the permissionless nature of Bitcoin and Lightning), yet still seem to value what we‚Äôre building from afar.

We‚Äôd also like to thank all the vendors who joined us - without your participation, the Flea Market wouldn‚Äôt have been nearly as much fun‚Ä¶ or really a market at all. üôÇ
