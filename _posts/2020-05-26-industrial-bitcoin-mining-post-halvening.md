## "Industrial Bitcoin Mining after the Halving and beyond" (29.05.20 - Online Event)


After our [initial Online Meetup](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/first-online-meetup/) from April 2020 during the Coronavirus-induced lockdown our local community decided that continuing this format in the light of continued travel restrictions remains a good way to remain in touch with those community members who currently are unable to attend the [weekly offline meetups](https://twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon/status/1257088502065291265) which resumed since early May.


Besides last week’s 10th anniversary of the [annual Bitcoin Pizza day](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/10th-anniversary-pizza-day/) the main event for Bitcoiners in May 2020 was certainly the [Halving day](https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-halving) on the 10th of May which was celebrated by various online events around the world.


In this light we decided to invite you for our next Online Meetup with [Steve Barbour](https://twitter.com/sgbarbour?lang=en) (Owner of [UpstreamData](https://www.upstreamdata.ca/)) and [Thomas Heller](https://twitter.com/thomasheller_?lang=en) (Global Business Director [F2Pool](https://www.f2pool.com/)) who both work with their respective companies at the cutting edge of the highly competitive space of industrial Bitcoin mining.


You can read an interview we conducted with Steve in February 2020 ahead of the CryptoEcon 2020 conference in Hanoi [here](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/interview-steve-barbour-upstreamdata/).
