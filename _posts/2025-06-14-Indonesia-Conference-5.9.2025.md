After a one-year break, the Bitcoin Indonesia Conference is set to return to the _Island of the Gods_ - organized by the dedicated crew behind Bitcoin House Bali.

The 2023 edition marked a key moment for the Southeast Asian Bitcoin community - serving as a crystallizing point to reconnect and strengthen regional ties after years of forced lockdowns and disrupted travel. It brought together builders, thinkers, and local organizers from across the region to rebuild the _human layer_ of the Bitcoin network in person.

True to Bali’s character, the local community delivered. The conference blended cultural side events, informal gatherings, and a relaxed atmosphere - far from your typical suit-and-lanyard Bitcoin business affair. Instead, it became a space where ideas flowed freely, and new connections were forged under palm trees rather than fluorescent lights.
