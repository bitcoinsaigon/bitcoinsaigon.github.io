After the success of our initial [Community Twitter spaces](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/twitter-space-jan-29/) in the past month, the crew behind decided to proceed to set up another one.

This time we will welcome Simon of the [Mempool.space]() project, an Open-Source Bitcoin Explorer which has established itself successfully as the standard across the industry (for more background on the project, you can also listen in to [SLP245]() with Simons fellow project maintainer [Wiz](https://www.twitter.com/@wiz).)

Simon is a [known face in Saigons Bitcoin Community](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/interview-simon-mempool-space/) and has been a regular at our meetups during his time in Vietnam.

The Twitter spaces will entail as usual an outlook for what's to come for Bitcoin and Bitcoiners in the upcoming decade, threat models and strategies how to mitigate them effectively.

And many more rabbit holes we might plunge into along the way. :)

The online event will take place on Saturday the 19th of February, 8 PM ITC, Bitcoin Saigon via the [Twitter spaces platform](https://media.twitter.com/en/articles/products/2021/twitter-spaces).

Follow the [Bitcoin Saigon Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon) for more updated information.
