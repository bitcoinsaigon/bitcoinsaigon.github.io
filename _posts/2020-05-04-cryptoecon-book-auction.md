## CryptoEconomics - Book Auction

It has been almost two months by now since the inaugural [CryptoEcon 2020](http://www.cryptoecon.org) took place in the West Lake district of Hanoi.

While certainly facing a lot of headwinds amidst the expanding global travel restrictions, lockdowns and other measures taken [Eric Voskuil](https://twitter.com/evoskuil) and his crew of supporters managed to throw together a memorable conference which certainly set a new standard in terms of the in-depth discussions around CryptoEconomics taking place at the event for Vietnam and beyond.

As part of the swag each participant got equipped with a limited edition of Eric Voskuil [collected writings on CryptoEconomics](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Cryptoeconomics) - in physical printed form.
