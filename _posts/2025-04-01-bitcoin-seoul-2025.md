Following the highly technical [Sats’n Facts Unconference in Chiang Mai](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/bitcoin-technical-conference-chiang-mai-2025/) earlier this year, the first Bitcoin-centric event for a wider audience in Asia in 2025 will take place this June in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.

Last year’s event attracted globally renowned Bitcoin spokespeople such as Saifedean Ammous and Jimmy Song, alongside key players from the domestic Korean Bitcoin scene. Representatives from the Vietnamese Bitcoin community, including [Albert Buu](twitter.com/subnetmask) of Neutronpay (now Neutron) and [Dominik Weil](https://twitter.com/DominikWeil) of BitcoinVN, also made an appearance to showcase the Vietnamese Bitcoin startup ecosystem.

This June, Seoul will once again become the center of Bitcoin's growing presence in Asia. While many conferences bring together the usual suspects, Bitcoin Seoul stands out by curating a unique blend of global thought leaders, local entrepreneurs, and innovators from the heart of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

If 2024 is any indication, you can expect discussions not only on Bitcoin’s technical advancements but also its cultural and social impact. Additionally, the moderate size of the event will provide you with the unique opportunity to connect directly with most speakers and attendees.

## South Korea’s significant role in Foreign Direct & Venture Investment in Vietnam

Korean venture capital has been particularly active in Vietnam’s startup ecosystem, with Korea Investment Partners and SoftBank Ventures Asia being among the leading investors. In recent years, Korean VCs have invested in a variety of sectors, from fintech (such as in Moca and ViettelPay) to e-commerce (including Tiki and Thegioididong). According to reports, Korean investors contributed over $1 billion USD to Vietnamese startups between 2019 and 2023, with a notable spike in interest following the pandemic as Vietnam’s tech scene accelerated.

Samsung plays a central role in Vietnam’s foreign direct investment (FDI) landscape, contributing significantly to the country’s economic growth. Samsung has invested over $17 billion USD in Vietnam, primarily in its mobile phone and consumer electronics manufacturing facilities. Samsung’s Vietnamese operations account for around 20% of Vietnam’s total export GDP, making it one of the largest contributors to the country’s exports. In 2022 alone, Samsung's exports from Vietnam totaled approximately $65 billion USD, underscoring its critical role in both local manufacturing and global supply chains.

South Korea, a country that emerged from the rubble of war to become a global leader in high-tech manufacturing, offers a fascinating case study for Vietnam, which is still climbing the value chain in domestic technological production. Between sessions, you’ll have the chance to experience first-hand why Seoul is regarded as one of the world’s most technologically advanced megacities outside mainland China.
