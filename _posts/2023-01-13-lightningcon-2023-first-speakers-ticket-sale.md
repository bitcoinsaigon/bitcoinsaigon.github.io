You likely clicked on this article because you heard over the past couple of weeks about the planned Bitcoin event in the beautiful beach city of Đà Nẵng along the coastline of Central Vietnam.

You have come to the right place.

![Lightning Con March 2023](images/lightningcon-2023-first-speakers-ticket-sale-1.jpg)

With the [official event website](lightningcon.org) being online since earlier this week, we can summarize the following key facts.

##When is it?

The core event days will be 23th and 24th of March of 2023.

##Where is it?

The event will take place beachside at the [Furama Resort Đà Nẵng](https://furamavietnam.com/vi/).

##Who is it for?

This is a Bitcoin only event.

Bitcoin written with a capital ₿.

Shitcoiners are actively discouraged from partaking in the event.

We want the builders, people who have done their homework and are willing to put in the hard work to understand Bitcoin and build out and strengthen the necessary infrastructure to move Bitcoin forward.

We live in serious times and we only have time for serious people.

##Who it isn’t for?

See above. 

If you’re into “cRyPtO” and gambling away your money on stuff you don’t really understand, there are approximately 500 other events per year for you to attend in Vietnam.

Stay away and expect toxicity and a very unpleasant time if you want to come and shill garbage to the attendees.

##Is there a real “Bitcoin Beach” à la El Zonte in Da Nang?

No.

The situation in El Salvador is very obviously incomparable to the situation in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

El Salvador enjoys very strong top-down support for Bitcoin adoption, which is neither the case nor to be expected any time soon in Vietnam.

Vietnam is a very nice place to live - if you respect and follow the important rules set.

The freedom you can enjoy in Vietnam has very obvious limitations and one is well-advised not to overstep these.

That said:

Vietnamese people are very entrepreneurial-minded, business-savvy and open to new technologies which bring them an advantage in life.

This is one of the key factors behind Vietnam’s current “Golden Years” which saw it as one of the fastest-growing economies during this millennium.

There is certainly a reason why an increasing number of Việt kiều and Western entrepreneurs are seeking out opportunities far away from the lands of their childhood.

Furthermore:

The team of [Neutronpay](neutronpay.com) has boots on the ground in Đà Nẵng since a few weeks, so yes, you will likely be able to buy stuff in and around the conference venue with your Sats.

##How can I pay for the tickets?

[Bitcoin only](https://lightningcon.org/#ticket).

##Any covid restrictions for traveling to Vietnam?

Nope.

We had especially in 2021 our fair share of harsh lockdown restrictions, but since fall of 2021 the “war on covid” has been declared victorious and hence life has bounced back to 2019-levels within very short succession.

Hop on the plane and arrive.

No tests, papers or quarantine required.

Like in the “good, ol’ before times”.

##How to get to Đà Nẵng?

Đà Nẵng has its own international airport and is relatively well-connected with flights from other countries in Asia.

Intercontinental travellers might have to do a stop-over in Hanoi or Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City); plenty of direct flights (approx. 1h) from there will lead you to Đà Nẵng.

And if you’re looking to book your flight in Bitcoin with full service from a travel agency with boots on the ground, we can wholeheartedly recommend [Future.Travel](future.travel).

Its owner [David Watson](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/farewell-david-watson/) has been spitting orange pills in discussion with fiat gateway providers since many years back and has been a steadfast supporter of the Bitcoin Community down in Saigon over the years.

Oh, and he also launched the [first Lightning ATM in Asia](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/first-lightning-atm-saigon-launches/) a couple of years ago.
