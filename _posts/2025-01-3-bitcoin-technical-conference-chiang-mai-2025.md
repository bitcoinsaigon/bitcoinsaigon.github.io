Bitcoiners heading to Southeast Asia in early 2025 may want to consider stopping by Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand.

From the 8th to the 10th of February 2025, the inaugural [Sats ‘n Facts Unconference](https://satsnfacts.btc.pub/#agenda) is set to take place at Weave Artisan Society, bringing together Bitcoin builders and powerful minds in the Bitcoin space to dive into topics like Scalability, Mining, Payments, Infrastructure, and much more.

Due to unfavorable climate and overly restrictive regulatory environments in their home countries, many digital nomads - especially from Europe - have been drawn to Chiang Mai. This influx has helped the city become one of the most promising and dynamic locations in Southeast Asia for Bitcoin development.

In the 2020s, Chiang Mai has become a vibrant hub for Bitcoiners to connect and collaborate, with well-known projects such as [GetAlby](https://www.getalby.com/), and various individuals and teams building solutions around [Ark Protocol](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/ark/), such as [Second](second.tech), have been establishing a significant presence in Thailand’s second-largest city.

[Sequentia](https://sequentia.io/), [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), and [Payjoin](https://payjoin.org/) will also be present, with key contributors from these Bitcoin open-source projects in attendance.

Please understand that this gathering is **highly targeted towards a technical audience** - it is not a "Bitcoin business/Commercial" or "Bitcoin community/adoption" style event.

## The Sats ‘n Facts Unconference will include two primary types of participants:

### Leads

Leads are expected to guide hands-on activities rather than deliver traditional presentations. These activities could range from technical hackathons or smaller operational tasks to off-tech workshops related to Bitcoin and similar technologies.

Even non-technical participants can lead; for example, a newbie coder might host a workshop titled "How to Scale/Hack My Learning Skills as a Coding Noob." The key criterion is the ability to offer a meaningful, interactive experience for attendees and share synergies with other FOSS Builders, Designers and Creators.

### Attendees

Attendees are those who have chosen to purchase tickets after undergoing scrutiny by the organizing team. They are expected to add value by actively participating in lead-driven activities or by creating ad-hoc, win-win collaborations during the event.

That said, with many Bitcoiners from the region likely to be in town, you’ll probably still have a great time hanging out in the area and enjoying the surrounding days with your fellow orange-clad friends.
