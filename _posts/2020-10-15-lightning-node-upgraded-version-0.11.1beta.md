Thanks to the relentless work by our community member [Tomo](https://twitter.com/tomoXtechno) and [Albert](https://twitter.com/subnetmask) the [community node](https://1ml.com/node/023b4948f45435c2a39a80792ef48fd2d9edc68ce7f3334c12248f42b91539c004) has been upgraded to the most [recent version of 0.11.1 beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.11.1-beta.rc2).

Among the new features in this release are:

- [10 BTC soft limit for Wumbo channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4567)
- Stability improvements which reduce amount of force-closed channels
- Nodes can be advertised by domain name
- More manual optionality in payment routing by selecting specific channels (improves channel rebalancing)

For more details you can also read the blog entry by [Bryan Vu](http://www.twitter.com/bvu) of [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/) on the release:

If you are looking to get more actively involved and see how the Lightning Network is used in a practical manner today, we would encourage you to pass by one of our weekly meetups in Saigon (or if not based here - check out for [a good Bitcoin meetup in your area](https://bitcoin-only.com/#meetups) :) ).
