After the resounding success of the inaugural [LightningCon Da Nang 2023 Conference](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/lightningcon-2023-da-nang-review-and-footage/ "LightningCon Da Nang 2023 Conference") which was followed a few days later by the first international [Bitcoin-only event in the Philippines](https://twitter.com/BtcRetreat) the conviction among the movers & shakers in the region has seen a significant boost in strength.

The time - with the end of the global fiat monetary regime approaching rapidly - as well as the critical mass of well-educated, principled and determined Bitcoiners achieved in the region have sparked a hunger for more regional Bitcoin-only events.

After a drought in the past decade where almost any event in the region was infiltrated and diluted by the usual shitcoin scammer crowd, the events in Da Nang and Boracay set the stage for highly selective Bitcoin-only events with a high level of conversation.

Cutting the noise, focus on the signal.

After Vietnam and the Philippines it is now time for Thailand to take the centre stage.

The crew around [Rightshift](https://rightshift.to/) and [BOB Space Bangkok](https://www.bobspaces.net/) have publicized the plans for the first regional Bitcoin-only event in Thailandâ€™s history.

#### [The event will take place in Bangkok on the 15th and 16th of July - so mark your calendar!](https://rightshift.to/btc2023/)

We expect a fair amount of our usual Bitcoin Saigon crew to make the trip - so we hope to connect with you there to build more regional ties across the Bitcoin communities in Southeast Asia.

If you want to learn more about the Bitcoin Community in Thailand, we also recommend you to listen in to the [Global Bitcoin Fest](https://www.globalbitcoinfest.com/) session with the Thai Bitcoin Community:
