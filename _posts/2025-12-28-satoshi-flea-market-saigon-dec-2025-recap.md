The Satoshi Christmas Flea Market Saigon took place on December 14 in its fourth iteration. Good memories were made, old connections refreshed, and new ones established \- continuing the work of building out the *“Layer Zero”* of the Bitcoin network.

The place was sprawling with happy kids enjoying the various attractions or joining our resident **Satoshi Santa** for a photo session for the family albums, while the adults were exploring the variety of vendors on site or simply enjoying good conversations with fellow Bitcoiners \- or quietly handing out the orange pill to a few promising pre-coiners in attendance.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who helped make this event a success and contributed in whatever way they could \- be it by putting in the hard work to organize the event, showing up in person, [providing financial support](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/donate-satoshis), or simply spreading the word to friends and family, whether in real life or on [social media](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/our-social-media). All of it is deeply appreciated and played its part in making the event the success it was.

Budget-wise, the final cost of the event exceeded the initially anticipated 1 million sats. After all costs were accounted for and all bills and suppliers paid, we came out at **1,376,632 sats**.

As such, we unfortunately fell slightly short of covering the event budget in the black \- despite the tremendous support received from Bitcoiners near and far in backing the continued grassroots efforts of the Saigon Bitcoin community.

While not an ultimate show-stopper, it will be essential going forward to run these events \- which require a significant allocation of time and effort from our organizing team \- on a non-negative basis.

We appreciate all the support received so far and are grateful for any additional Sats you might consider sending our way, to help keep these types of events financially sustainable for the community.

We hope everyone had a Merry Christmas, and we wish everyone a fruitful & fertile 2026 ahead\!
