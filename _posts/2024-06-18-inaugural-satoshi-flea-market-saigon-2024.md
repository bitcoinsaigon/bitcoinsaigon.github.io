After a long hiatus, the Bitcoin Saigon community resurfaces with its first public event of the year:

## The inaugural Satoshi Flea Market Saigon

Since motion pictures are often more powerful than words in conveying a message, the inspiration comes from various similar community-based events around the world, such as those seen in El Salvador:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> farmers market in 🇸🇻 El Salvador has what you’re looking for 👀<br><br> <a href="https://t.co/UDk1lJd4Fa">pic.twitter.com/UDk1lJd4Fa</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1788603569421132158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## What to expect?

Genuine people, authentic products.

It’s a rather casual event for friends and family of the extended community to showcase their arts and crafts. 

We aim to cultivate a community and strengthen the ties among its members, aligned with the Bitcoin ethos: low time preference, long-term thinking, and a strive for excellence and the best quality (versus the “throwaway” culture cultivated by fiat monetary systems).

…some participants might also sell unnecessary furniture or similar second-hand items in exchange for some more Sats in their wallets (IYKYK).

It is not a “crypto event”.

If you are looking for tips on the “hottest new memecoin of the week” or alternatively are looking for fools to dump your shitcoin bags on… please stay away.

## Who are the vendors?

You will find something to eat and drink, as well as artisanal crafts, artistic items, and second-hand goodies looking for a new home.

All vendors are part of the extended Bitcoin Saigon community, and we hold ourselves to high standards and principles.

However, since it is an inaugural event and we are not professional event organizers, please be patient if not everything works “polished” on the first attempt.

If we decide to hold another iteration in a few months, we will seek to improve based on the feedback provided and the experiences gained.

## When and where?

- **Address:** Indika Saigon (43 Đ. Nguyễn Văn Giai, Đa Kao, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh 710359, Vietnam)

- **Date:** Afternoon of 28th of July (Sunday) 2024

***Disclaimer**: In line with current State Bank regulations, no official transactions will be conducted in cryptocurrency during the event. VND will be accepted as the means of payment at all booths.*
