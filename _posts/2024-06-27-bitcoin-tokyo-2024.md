A cultural trailblazer with a global impact, offering everything from sushi to the Nintendo, Sony and various world-leading gaming studios which found their way into every young male’s home in the 1990’s.

Japan boasts a world-leading high-speed rail network and diverse natural scenery, from the tropical paradise of Okinawa…

…to the frozen north of Hokkaido, Asia’s skiing haven. Hokkaido is also home to some of Japan’s most revered agricultural products, from world-class dairy and potatoes…

And of course Tokyo, Japan's capital and the world's largest metropolitan area, which in the roaring 80s was the global center of economic activity.

In economic and monetary terms, Japan also made some globally impactful history in recent decades:

From the spectacular implosion of the economic, real estate, and stock market bubble, leading to decades of experimentation with low interest rates and ballooning debt levels…

…to the 2024 implosion of Japan’s currency, one of the largest worldwide, which lost over 30% of its value versus the US Dollar in mere months.

But Japan also made headlines in the Bitcoin world:

The pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto” is of Japanese origin, and the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox was based and operated out of Shibuya in Tokyo. Mt. Gox handled over 90% of global Bitcoin trading volume, playing a crucial role in the early Bitcoin ecosystem.

Further large exchange hacks by regulated exchanges such as Coincheck and DMM, both resulting in losses of hundreds of millions worth of BTC, soured the climate. Regulations in Japan were often perceived as detrimental to the growth of domestic entrepreneur-driven innovation in the sector.

With the domestic currency in deep trouble, the question resurges: 

**Is it time for Bitcoin in Japan?**

We shall find out at [Bitcoin Tokyo 2024, on the 21st and 22nd of September](https://bitcoinconference.tokyo/en/) this year.
