Ho ho ho! It’s that time of year again - Satoshi Claus is coming to town, and he's spreading the holiday cheer with a Satoshi Christmas Flea Market in Saigon.

Join us for the 2nd edition of the **Satoshi Flea Market - Christmas Special,** a gathering of the local Bitcoin community members, along with friends and family who embody a lower time preference approach in food, art, manufacturing as well as environmental and family values.

This festive get-together celebrates the Bitcoin spirit with a chance to support local businesses, get your hands on some unique gifts, and, of course, **trade your Sats\***.

From handcrafted goods to Bitcoin swag and locally crafted culinary fare, we’ve got something for everyone to enjoy!
