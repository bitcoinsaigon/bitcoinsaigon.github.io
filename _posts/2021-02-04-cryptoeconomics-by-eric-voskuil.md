[Eric Voskuil](http://www.twitter.com/evoskuil) - [Libbitcoin Lead Maintainer](https://github.com/libbitcoin), Lead Organizer of the [CryptoEcon event](https://cryptoecon.org/) and past [Bitcoin Saigon guest speaker](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Bitcoin-Saigon-Meetup/events/259622127/) - has released his collected writings on the matter of Bitcoin and the underlying economic incentives which make the system work as Paperback & [Amazon Kindle version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1735060828).
 
> “Do you think you know something about Bitcoin and Austrian Economics? If so you may be ready for Cryptoeconomics. This is not a work for the uninitiated. The content is dense – it does not repeat itself. It is not a contribution to the echo chamber, will not show you how to set up a wallet, the future price, or what to do.

> Cryptoeconomics applies rational economic principles to Bitcoin, demonstrating flaws and unnecessary complexities in them, and in common understandings of Bitcoin. It will improve your understanding of both. Bitcoin requires a new, rigorous, and comprehensive discipline. This is it.”
 
If you missed out on securing your own version during CryptoEcon2020 in Hanoi or on our lucky draw in the past year - now is you got another chance to complete your library of essential Bitcoin books.
