The last big gathering of Bitcoiners in South East Asia in 2023 is approaching fast:

By the end of next month (26th/27th of October) the friends of the orange coin will gather, meet and debate at the peaceful island of Bali, Indonesia to round up a year which has seen a more bustling regional Bitcoin community activity than ever before.

After successful events in Da Nang, Boracay (Philippines) and Bangkok it is now time for the Indonesian Bitcoin community to take up the host role.
