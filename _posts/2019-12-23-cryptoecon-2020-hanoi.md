After several months of preparation this week saw finally the official announcement of [CryptoEcon 2020](http://www.cryptoecon.org/) in Hanoi, which by all measures will likely be the unmatched Bitcoin-centric event of the year for Vietnam, which has been flooded by low-quality, scammy "Blockchain" events but starved for real, valuable content for far too long.

CryptoEcon 2020 is designed to be a match in terms of speaker selection and quality to other Bitcoin-focused events like e.g. the Baltic Honeybadger conference; however, it will put a specific focus on the economic aspects of Bitcoin and the incentives with which all participants in the network act which results in the volatile, but so far resilient equillibrium in which the Bitcoin network operates in order to withstand any system-threatening attack vectors.

CryptoEcon 2020 is a project by the non-profit [Libbitcoin Institute](https://libbitcoininstitute.org/) and a brainchild of its Lead Developer [Eric Voskuil](https://twitter.com/evoskuil), who has in the past already been speaking at the local meetups in [Saigon](https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Saigon-Meetup/events/259622127/) and Hanoi.

If you are into Bitcoin and live in or around Vietnam - this conference is certainly a "must-do" on your calendar!
