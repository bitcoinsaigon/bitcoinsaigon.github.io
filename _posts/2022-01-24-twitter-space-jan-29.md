It certainly has been a while since there’s been an opportunity to catch up with the Saigonese Bitcoin community online.

While the weekly physical Bitcoin meetups in town have resumed to their usual pattern - for those of you who are currently still outside Vietnam’s borders and/or have otherwise no opportunity to take part at the meetups on the ground (for those interested: [Borders in Vietnam start to be finally semi-open](https://twitter.com/DominikWeil/status/1472855134661054469)), our local community members [Lukas](http://www.twitter.com/\@\duczko) & [Dominik](http://www.twitter.com/DominikWeil) drummed together some of our regular faces to share their ideas and insights online.

On Saturday the 29th of January, 8 PM ITC, Bitcoin Saigon will host a Twitter Spaces event - discussing all things Vietnam, Bitcoin and where we all might go from here.

Follow the [Bitcoin Saigon Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/BitcoinSaigon) for more updated information.
