*Update 18.01.23:  LNTXBot is [announced to sunset](https://t.me/lntxbot_dev/86735) by its creator Fiatjaf. All LNTXBot users are encouraged to withdraw their remaining Sats from LNTXBot. Fiatjaf's main focus has shifted - among other things - towards advancing the social networking protocol [Nostr](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/now-also-on-nostr/).*

While the Bitcoin & Lightning ecosystem is seeing fast progress in the development in more user-friendly Lightning Wallet options, one of the most simple ways to receive your first Sats is via the [LNTXBOT](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot) by [fiatjaf](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf?lang=en), a Lightning Wallet which allows every Telegram user to send & receive Sats without further ado.

Besides sending & receiving Sats via your LNTXBOT wallet, you can also offer a variety of other services like crowdfunding, fundraising, an ad market place and plenty of other integrated options to make use of your Sats. To set up a LNTXBOT wallet on your Telegram account simply message: @LNTXBOT and a wallet is set up. To understand your wallet functions type /help â€¦. to check your balance type:  /balance

With the addition of Telegram to our [regular communication channels](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/our-social-media.html), you can now also directly donate Sats to support the community work via [LNTXBOT](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot).

To do so enter simply the command to e.g. donate 1,000 Sats:

```
/send 1000 @Bitcoin_Saigon
```

into your Telegram chat with @lntxbot.

#### As a warning: Funds on LNTXBot are fully custodial and you trust a third party with your funds. 

While a great way to get started & make your first steps with Lightning - do not put more funds on it than you can afford to lose.

For security your Telegram account should be set up with 2 factor security (2FA) so a loss of your phone does not mean a loss of your sats.

The target use case is for micro- & and other small payments only, not for transferring large amounts of value!
