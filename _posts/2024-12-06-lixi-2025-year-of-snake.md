## **Bitcoin Lì Xì**

In Vietnam it is customary to gift money for special occasions, especially Lunar New Year (Tết), weddings and births. The cash is typically enclosed in a red envelope (also called red pocket, Bao lì xì).

The envelope is gifted, the recipient takes out the cash from the envelope.

The Bitcoin Lì Xì achieves the same experience using LNURL-withdrawal QR codes that can be gifted electronically or physically.

Happy year of the Snake!

## **Redeeming Your Bitcoin Lì Xì**

To redeem your Lì Xì, you need a Lightning wallet that supports LNURL-withdrawal.

Some of the top-recommended wallets include:

- [Blink](https://www.blink.sv/)
- [Neutronpay](https://neutronpay.com/)
- [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/)
- [Zeus](https://zeusln.com/)

You can find [a complete list here.](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-lnurl/#wallets)

Simply scan the QR code of your Bitcoin Lì Xì. You are shown the amount you are able to withdraw. Confirm, and the funds should appear in your wallet.

## **Acknowledgements**

We would like to thank especially [Leo Weese](https://www.twitter.com//@/LeoAW) and the crew of the [Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong](https://www.bitcoin.org.hk/) for their foundational support in making the Laisee/ Lì Xì campaign a regular occurrence amidst our local Bitcoin communities.

Their continued pioneering efforts, their valuable advice, and their infrastructure support have been significant in bringing the Bitcoin Lì Xì campaign to Saigon.

Furthermore, we would like to repeat our thanks to the countless teams working on the [Lightning Network](http://lightning.network/), specifically [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd), the team at [LNbits](https://lnbits.com/), as well as [Bitcarrot](https://github.com/BitCarrot).

Ongoing gratitude also to all our individual donors among the global Bitcoin community who parted with some of their precious Sats to make this campaign work.

Sats flowing in a permissionless monetary system from one end of the world to the other without the need for a third party.

Last but not least we would like to thank our corporate donors to cover the printing and manufacturing expenses of this campaign.
