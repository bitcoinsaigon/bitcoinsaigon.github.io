_TL, DR: Fundraising to cover the costs of the upcoming Christmas Satoshi Flea Market Saigon 2025 is live - either directly via our [donation page](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/donate-satoshis) or via the [official Geyser campaign](https://geyser.fund/project/satoshifleamarketsaigonsummer2025/prelaunch?hero=bitcoinsaigon1)_.

After the inaugural success of our Satoshi Christmas Flea Market 2024, we’re coming back for another round - **mark your calendars for December 14th**.

As with our most recent summer Flea Market, the Christmas edition will once again take place at **Big Bếp** _(previously known as “Funk Factory”)_ in District 2 - the perfect home base for relaxed vibes, good talks and a growing community of Bitcoiners and (hopefully) soon-to-be-Bitcoiners (_“promising precoiners”_ in community parlance).

Once more, our community has grown in size - many of our core members spent this year productively by adding to their family line.

The event is decisively family-friendly and will also cater to the next generation.

The future is not only built on technology — but by the humans who will inhabit and shape both its physical and spiritual realm.

Launched in the summer of 2024 and inspired by successful Satoshi Flea Markets around the world — from the **[Bitcoin Farmers Market in El Salvador](https://linktr.ee/bitcoinfarmersmarket)** to the **[Lightning Marché in Tokyo](https://bitcoin-zukan.com/en/practical/lightning-marche/)** - we are coming together for the fourth time, building out “layer zero” of network one human connection at a time.

Since then, it has grown into an emerging local tradition and even attracted “high-profile visitors” from the global Bitcoin community - including Ms. Bitcoin from El Salvador, who attended the previous Christmas edition of the bi-annual event.

In order to make an impact:

Funding by the wider community is needed to keep this communal grassroots event sustainable.

While the costs of the event are kept modest, there are still costs associated with the whole event logistics to make it a pleasant experience for visitors and vendors alike.

And the kids want their entertainment too :)

We intentionally **keep vendor fees very affordable** to make it accessible for friends and family of the community to showcase their homemade cookies, crafts, and passion projects, rather than turning it into a commercial market dominated by professional vendors.

**The financial shortfall must be funded from the community treasury reserves.**

Relying on our treasury is limiting, that is why we also count on donations from Bitcoiners around the world to help us continue spreading the orange signal and foster community connections here in Vietnam.

The event itself isn’t limited to Bitcoiners - but most vendors are within the wider network of the local community, operating with a mindset that’s naturally aligned with Bitcoin values.

You could call them highly promising pre-coiners - individuals already living the ethos, just waiting for the final piece to click into place.

Quality and pride in their product, not just quick money grab - the very work ethos which we believe makes them also ready to endorse Bitcoin as honest money for honest people.

Especially in a place like Vietnam - where the term “crypto” has become toxic, and most decent people instinctively and rightfully recoil when they hear it - it’s more important than ever to show that Bitcoin represents something fundamentally different.

Bitcoiners are - and proudly so - a different breed.

We reject the shallow, extractive mentality of the shitcoin Pump-n-Dump crowd - those who lie, cheat, and leave everything worse than they found it in the name of fast profit.

Bitcoin is about building.

Building trust. Building real value.

And building a future that doesn’t rot from the inside out.

As usual, **shitcoiners are not welcome** - but anyone aligned with the Bitcoin ethos and a love for organic food, handmade goods, and natural living will feel right at home.

As always, it’s a family-friendly gathering - kids running around, home-baked cookies, good conversations and true value-for-value exchange taking place - building for a brighter tomorrow.

A recap on our previous [Summer 2025 Flea Market can be found here](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/Satoshi-Flea-Market-recap-2025/).

**Fundraising goal**

We currently estimate a total budget of around 1,000,000 sats to cover the full event logistics.

## **We’re grateful for [every single Sat you’re willing to contribute](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/donate-satoshis) to help make it happen - and even more so if you can show up in person and be part of the experience :)**
