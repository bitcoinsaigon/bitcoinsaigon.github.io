**_TL, DR: Ticketing for Bitcoin Thailand 2024 is open ([Lightning accepted](https://rightshift.to/product/tbc2024-event-ticket/))_**

Looking to connect with more solid Bitcoiners in Southeast Asia?

If you missed the [inaugural Thai Bitcoin Conference in 2023](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/bitcoin-thailand-conference-2023/) and the more recent [Bitcoin Conference in Seoul, Korea](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/bitcoin-in-asia-korea-2024/), you'll have another chance soon.

Given geographical realities, this is the **only Bitcoin conference in Southeast Asia in 2024**, as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bali/Indonesia have decided to take a break this year.

Yes, organizing events at this scale is exhausting, especially when the goal is to keep the event free from "shitcoiners" to maximize value for the participants.

Budgets are tight for this reason, so if you're wondering how you can support the team in Thailand go for another round in 2024:

* If your organization is committed to the Bitcoin ethos and can afford it, **consider a sponsorship package**
* If you‚Äôre a Bitcoiner located in the area, **[buy a ticket](https://rightshift.to/product/tbc2024-event-ticket/)** (and have some patience and equanimity with the organizing team‚Äîthey are mostly volunteers, not professional event organizers üôè )
* If you can‚Äôt make it but still want to support the good folks in Thailand: **Write about the event on your Nostr, social media accounts, blogs, or email lists.** It is highly appreciated by the organizers, who usually go through hell and back to put on such an event.

We shall see everyone in Bangkok, Thailand in September!
