With the increasing censorship on most major “BigTech”-owned Social Media platforms, we are offering from now on also a [Telegram Announcement](https://bitcoinsaigon.org/our-social-media.html) channel for any news from the Community.

While Telegram might not be the ultimate solution to win the battle for privacy and free & open communications, it is currently a platform with sufficient adoption in our space while not being plagued by constant content moderation & censorship issues.

We will as a community strive to continue to diversify & strengthen our communication tools in order to be resilient when the war on [Open Source, Open Communications and Open Source Money will rage its next escalation stages](https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/1319943369582231552).
